+ clean API.

Configuration
-------------

### Facebook

Apart from the usual configuration make sure you configure URIs properly:

1. Go to your facebook app console
2. Go to Settings -> Basic. In Site URL type your url, even if localhost. For example: `http://localhost:4200`
3. Go to Settings -> Advanced. In Valid OAuth redirect URIs type your url, even if localhost. For example: `http://localhost:4200`

Otherwise you might experience weird issues, like redirects to the facebook home page.

Development
-----------

It's a regular Angular application, after unchecking just run

    git submodules update # this will get spectre CSS framework
    yarn install --frozen-lockfile # install dependencies
    yarn start # launch the example application
